# About
Plant Pathologists, Bioinformatician and Postdoctoral Fellow at Oklahoma State University. I currently work on developing
bioinformatic tools to rapidly detect plant pathogens. I use RNA and DNA shotgun sequencing to rapidly query for known and
unknown plant pathogens. I am interested in developing innovative bioinformatic tools to help plant pathologists detect known and emerging pests.
By using Next Generation Sequencing we aim to understand the appropriate conditions to successfully detect any pathogen in any plant sample.
