# About
Plant Pathologists, Bioinformatician and Postdoctoral Fellow at Oklahoma State University. I currently work with DNA/RNA sequencing data to develop
bioinformatic tools to rapidly and accurate detect plant pathogens. I am interested in fast and innovative tools that help plant pathologists
detecting known and emerging pests.
By using Next Generation Sequencing we aim to understand the appropriate conditions to successfully detect any pathogen in any plant sample.
