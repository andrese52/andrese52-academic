summary= "Analyzing metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing datasets can cause a lot of trouble when excesive depth is utilized. This is true for microbiome studies that include the host background in the dataset. De-hosting by mapping the total dataset to the host genome could help with the assembly of this type of datasets."
