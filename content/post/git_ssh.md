[Previously](https://www.aespindola.com/post/git_basics/) I have explored how would be the common way of `pushing` (uploading) changes to your repository. However in many instances
we require to test our code in linux platforms and pushing code directly from linux becomes a little annoying when we have to type our username and password every single time.

I've found a nice video on how to incorporate ssh keys to our github repository.
